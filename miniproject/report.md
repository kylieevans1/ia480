# House Price Prediction Report

## Overview

The data used for this report is sourced from Kaggle's "House Prices" dataset. The goal of the analysis was to predict house prices based on various factors such as area, number of bathrooms, and number of floors.

## Methodology

### Target Variable:
- **Price**: The target variable that represents the price of the house.

### Key Predicting Features:
- **Area**: The area of the house.
- **Bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms in the house.
- **Floors**: The number of floors in the house.

### Data Preprocessing:
- **No data cleaning** was performed.

### Model:
- A **quick build** was used to train the model with default settings.

## Results

- The **RÂ² score** of the model was **-7.8%**. This indicates that the model performed poorly, suggesting that the chosen features or model might not have been ideal for the prediction task.

## Conclusion

The model did not effectively predict house prices. After experimenting with different variables, it became apparent that the chosen dataset might not have been suitable for this task. More comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering might be required for better results.
